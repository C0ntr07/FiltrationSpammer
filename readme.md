# Known Issues:
- Spammer thread does not properly wait for call to end/fail. (Easily fixable, just donâ€™t have much time)
- Message playing (to scammer) does not yet work because the call ends quickly. Again, an easy fix.

- Simple to use, check the settings tab for inputting your twilio account SID and Auth key.
- Add multiple outgoing numbers to cycle through
- Custom settings class (ion.cs) for serializing all settings into (%APPDATA%\Scamira Anti-scam solutions\FiltrationSpammer\1.0.0.0\settings.json)
- Leave no scammer un-dialed!
